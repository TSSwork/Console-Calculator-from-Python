# Console-Calculator-from-Python
It's simple calculator code written in Python using only the basics.
This was written as beginner of python programming.When I try to find calcultor code in the github before,and i wasn't satisfied from them.
Because they all were limited to one or two varibles and you can put into action  two numbers with one operator.
So I made this cal That can Continuously get the numbers user want to add and put in action the operators user add respectively.
Note:This doesn't follow the mathematical way of counting.
as a example if you add following:
5+3-4/2*3
Answer will be:6
This happens because the code was written to do the counting respectively.
